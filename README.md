## 2. Story and Setting

**Background:**  
In the distant future, Earth faces an existential threat from an alien armada intent on wiping out humanity. As the Commander of Earth's last defense forces, it's your responsibility to harness the planet’s remaining resources, integrate alien technology, and fend off the invaders.

**Setting:**  
The game is set in Earth's orbit and the surrounding space, with a focus on a futuristic, technologically advanced Earth. The planet's surface is visible from above, with a grid layout representing areas where players can place nodes, outposts, and other structures.

## 3. Gameplay Mechanics

### 3.1 Resource Management

- **Resource Nodes:** Players place resource-generating nodes on the Earth's surface. These nodes can produce various resources essential for building and upgrading defenses.
- **Alien Tech Debris:** After defeating alien ships, players can harvest debris, which provides the advanced materials needed to unlock powerful modules and upgrades.
- **Harvesters:** Harvesters are space-based units that collect alien debris from specific nodes in orbit. Players must build and manage these to access higher-tier technologies.

### 3.2 Building and Upgrades

- **Outposts:** Players can place different types of outposts around the planet. These can include defensive turrets, resource storage, and repair docks for ships.
- **Orbital Shields:** A critical Earth defense module with limited HP that can be unlocked by collecting enough alien tech. The shield can block a limited number of enemy attacks before depleting.
- **Module Upgrades:** Each outpost can be upgraded with various modules, such as force shields, repair drones, or enhanced weaponry. Outposts have a limit on how many modules can be equipped.

### 3.3 Defensive Strategies

- **Tower Defense:** Alien invaders trickle in tower-defense style, attacking from various angles. Players must strategically place outposts to cover all approaches.
- **Wormhole Events:** Occasionally, aliens will open wormholes to bypass outer defenses, forcing players to adapt quickly to new threats.
- **Earth’s Health Bar:** The planet itself has a health bar that decreases if alien ships break through defenses and attack the surface. Players must prevent this at all costs.

### 3.4 Combat and Tactics

- **Alien Waves:** Alien ships arrive in waves, with each wave increasing in difficulty. Some ships may steal resources or attack key structures before retreating.
- **Repair Ships:** Space-based outposts can deploy repair ships to damaged structures. These ships can only operate within a limited perimeter around the outpost.
- **Strategic Countdown:** A countdown timer indicates the time before the next wave of alien attacks. Players must use this time to gather resources, upgrade defenses, and prepare for battle.
